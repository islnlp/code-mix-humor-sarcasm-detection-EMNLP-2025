"A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man.

You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.",Sarcasm
I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead.

"jp: you keep spouting the same inaccuracy. i have already given you the cornell law schools definition and explanation of the impeachment process. do you need harvard and dukes as well? the house brought a resolution of impeachment. the senate denied it. the house resolution is similar to an indictment. the senate denial is similar to a not guilty verdict. your need to distort demeans you. really? who are you, carnack the magnificent? you can tell what would happen. richard nixon resigned and his offense was not as serious for the national security as the underlying offense is for libby. bottom line is you dont know what would happen. nobody does. but is does reveal that the only basis for you erroneous rhetoric is your speculation and distortion..",Non-sarcasm
